# Mikrotik-blockList

# Herein lies some information for the installation and configuration of the lists usage. Also some controls and checks which are easy to use for testing configuration.

# You may upoad your .rsc to an accessible website and then use a script in your Mikrotik devices to fetch the file and install the list. 
# this makes it easier to manage / edit your list from one place and let your devices download and update upon a schedule.

# In my case i use this code in the script section of Mikrotik and call the script Blacklist


##  First the download script 

# Create a script and name it :-

DownloadBlackList

# the body content :-

/tool fetch url="https://www.worldwidetech.com.au/blacklist.rsc" mode=http;
:log info "Downloaded Blacklist.rsc from WorldWideTech.com.au";



## Test

# When you run the script and it completes properly you will see the file named "your file name" appear in the Mikrotik Files section. 
# In the case above you will download a file named blacklist.rsc


## The script which loads the list


# Create a script which replaces the old lists with the new downloaded lists 

#Name the script :-

ReplaceBlackList


#Contents of the script:-



/ip firewall address-list remove [find where comment="blacklist"]
/import file-name=blacklist.rsc;
:log info "Removed old Blacklist records and imported new list";


## Test 


# When you run this script you will see the list created and the additional sites if any populate into the address list on the mikrotik


## Scheduling

# You will now need to create a schedule to download and run the script on a regular interval if you wish to automate the system.

# Create a Schedule and name it :-

DownloadBlackList

# The content of the schedule will be the name of the script, in my case, in the case above >-
DownloadBlackList

# Create a schedule to install / Replace the old list with the new

# Name it :- 
Install DownloadBlackList


Contents of the schedule :-

ReplaceDownloadBlackList


# Important the naming convention is usually the problem with non functional list, check and check again...
